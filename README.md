# React Redux Todo APP Example

## Learning Redux

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
(If youâ€™re looking for a WordPress framework, check out Redux Framework.)

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.

You can use Redux together with React, or with any other view library.

## Learning React

> React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. Its core principles are declarative code, efficiency, and flexibility. Simply specify what your component looks like and React will keep it up-to-date when the underlying data changes.

## Running

The app is built with [JSX](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) and compiled at runtime for a lighter and more fun code reading experience. As stated in the link, JSX is not mandatory.
Install the dependencies and start the server.

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```

### Static Files

You can store static files like images, fonts, etc in the `build` folder.

For example, if you copy a file called my_image.png into the build folder you can access it using `http://localhost:3000/build/my_image.png`.

### Dependencies

* React
* Webpack
* [babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader)
* [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server)
